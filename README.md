### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<p>
  My name is AgustÃ­n, I am a software developer from Uruguay, living in Barcelona, â€‹â€‹Spain.<br>
  Actually I am studying at 42Barcelona and on my own in my free time.
  
  I enjoy to learn technologies related to web development, and most of my projects are related to that.<br>
  A lot of my repositories are informal side projects with a lot of bad practices or study notes
  from the code school, but all of that is to improve my coding skills.
