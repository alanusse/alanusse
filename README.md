  <h3>Hi there 👋</h3>

  My name is Agustín, I am a software developer from Uruguay, living in Barcelona, ​​Spain.<br>
Actually I am studying at 42Barcelona and on my own in my free time.

I enjoy to learn technologies related to web development, and most of my projects are related to that.<br>
A lot of my repositories are informal side projects with a lot of bad practices or study notes
from the code school, but all of that is to improve my coding skills.
