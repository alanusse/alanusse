  <h3>Hi there ðŸ‘‹</h3>

My name is AgustÃ­n, and I am a software developer originally from Uruguay, currently residing in Barcelona, Spain.<br>
I am pursuing studies at 42Barcelona and also dedicating time to self-study in my free time.

I enjoy learning about technologies related to web development, and most of my projects are in this field.<br>
Many of my repositories contain informal side projects and study notes from coding school, which include a lot of bad practices.<br>
However, all of these efforts are aimed at improving my coding skills.
